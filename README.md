Send Email from ruby
====================


Here I made an email set-up using ActionMailer

Download this project and run following commands

1. rake db:create 
2. rake db:migrate
3. rails server

After running the server visit localhost:3000 and create an user. Email will generate and send to that user mail-id.

Dont forget to set your gmail id and password in environment/development.rb configuration file

I explain step by step how I made this email set-up in README.rdoc file.
